1.  Analyze financial records of company.  budget_data.csv
2. Dataset has two columns:  DATE and PROFIT / LOSSES.  

3. Create a script that calculates the following: 
	a. Total number of months included in the dataset
	b. Net total amount of "Profit / Losses" over the entire period
	c. Greatest increase in profit (date and amount) over the entire period
	d. Greatest Decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

4. Print final script to terminal and export to text file results. 
______________________________________________________
1. import CSV called budget_data.csv
2. (convert any data?)
3. Header - Finiancial Analysis
4. Column headers:  Total Months:, Total, Greatest Increase in Profits:, Greatest Decrease in (?) 
5. Count number of months? Store in variable:  How do I find the unique value of each month to count?  
	There are a total of 86 unique DAYS represented.  How to the find the number of months ...
6. sum the total column of profit / loss and store in variable
	SPLIT profit / loss and store for percentages
7.  Find Date and amount of the greatest increase in profit Store in variable
8.  Find data and amount of greatest decrease in loss Store in variable
9. print to terminal
10. export to text -- Financial Analysis PyBank.txt

# First we'll import the os module
# This will allow us to create file paths across operating systems
import os

# Module for reading CSV files
import csv

csvpath = os.path.join('..', 'PythonStuff', 'budget_data.csv')

# # Method 1: Plain Reading of CSV files
# with open(csvpath, 'r') as file_handler:
#     lines = file_handler.read()
#     print(lines)
#     print(type(lines))


# Method 2: Improved Reading using CSV module

with open(csvpath, newline='') as csvfile:

    # CSV reader specifies delimiter and variable that holds contents
    csvreader = csv.reader(csvfile, delimiter=',')

    print(csvreader)

    # Read the header row first (skip this step if there is now header)
    csv_header = next(csvreader)
    print(f"CSV Header: {csv_header}")

    # Read each row of data after the header
    for row in csvreader:
        print(row)


OR TO OPEN
with open(csvpath, newline="") as csvfile:
    csvreader = csv.reader(csvfile, delimiter=",")






LAST STEPS

WRITE THE FILE
# Dependencies
import os
import csv

# Specify the file to write to
output_path = os.path.join("..", "output", "new.csv")

# Open the file using "write" mode. Specify the variable to hold the contents
with open(output_path, 'w', newline='') as csvfile:

    # Initialize csv.writer
    csvwriter = csv.writer(csvfile, delimiter=',')

    # Write the first row (column headers)
    csvwriter.writerow(['First Name', 'Last Name', 'SSN'])

    # Write the second row
    csvwriter.writerow(['Caleb', 'Frost', '505-80-2901'])
